In this final. You will be an n8n workflow which will be implement RAG workfow.

You can copy the workflow from
https://n8n.io/workflows/5010-rag-starter-template-using-simple-vector-stores-form-trigger-and-openai/

You still have access to my n8n server: 
https://n8n.srv1046399.hstgr.cloud/

If you forgot username/password just tell me, il reset.

For testing you can use sample 'n8n and rag.txt'. But if you want you can use your own information.
It might work well with PDF as well. TEST it.
