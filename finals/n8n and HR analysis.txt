Use n8n and AI to solve HR hiring problem.

The workflow will accept a job description and Candidate CV 
and will perform an analysis if the candidate is suitable for the job.

The flow:

1. Create a form which would allow to submit 4 things:
 - Job title
 - Job description
 - Allows to upload a CV (to PDF)

2. Upload CV to Google Drive
3. Downloads CV from Google Drive for analysis.

4. Extracts the data from the CV.

5. Sends the 'CV data' and 'job description' to AI agent which creates a report for this 
and gives 'job compactability' score which can be from 1 to 10. Provides reasoning.
Generates a report with this data.

6. The report gets placed into Google Drive for HR to analyse later.

7. If the score < 6, another agent generates an generic apology letter based on job description 
and sends the applicant an email. (only test with your CV of course)
