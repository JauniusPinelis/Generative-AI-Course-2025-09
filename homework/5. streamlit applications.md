You will practice creating a streamlit app with Visual Studio Code (Github copilot).

1. Jaunius mentioned that 'there should be only 1 project per folder'. 
Create a 'projects' folder where u will hold the AI projects.
Create a 'Lithuania-travel-planner' folder and open Vscode in it.

2. Create 'docs' folder and write up the 'task'. 
Dont try to create the whole project in one go.
First create a 'streamlit chatbot with google AI studio that accepts api-key in the textbox'
Create 'docs' folder and 'requirements.md'

3. copy documentation from Context7 into your files:
https://context7.com/websites/streamlit_io
https://context7.com/googleapis/python-genai

4. Create a file 'streamlit-chatbot.py' which will contain the code.

5. Run the prompt with Github copilot. Include the documentation and 'streamlit-chatbot.py' in the context.

6. Install the required libraries and launch the chatbot.
pip install streamlit
pip install google-generativeai

Get Google AI Studio API Key

streamlit run streamlit-chatbot.py

7. TEST and check for errors.

---------------------------------------------------

8. Ask AI to create the same application that was in 'Homework 4'

Advanced, Optional:

9. Upload this code to Github repository (be careful not to expose api-key)
