Functional requirements:

I would like to create an application which helps to plan traveling in Lithuania.

The application should ask for two inputs:

1. Activities that you like: I.E. Hiking, Cooking.
2. Days (to spend in Lithuania). I.E 

Upon entering the parameters, the program should print the itenery of the trip in Lithuania.

----------------------

The program should be in Python. it should be a console application.

Steps:
1. Install github copilot in Vscode.
https://github.com/features/copilot
2. The application should use Google AI Studio. So you will need to specify that in the prompt or update the task above to contain.
3. You will need to extract and save somewhere the Google ai Studio api-key.

4. You will need to pass 'Google AI studio' documentation to the LLM.
Get it from Context7.com and paste it into a file.
5. You will need to pass api-key into the code. Github copilot can do it for you.
6. Test the application.
