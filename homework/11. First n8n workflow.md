This homework is about getting familiar with creating your own workflow (and AI agent).

Please create a n8n form with 2 fields:
- topic
- recipient (email)

The form should trigger an AI agent and AI agent should write a summary on that topic and send an email (from your gmail) to the recipient.

Once the workflow is done. Please send a summary on 'GEN ai in Lithuania' to jauniuspinelis@gmail.com
