In previous homework you have implemented 
https://n8n.io/workflows/5922-create-food-emoji-icons-with-openai-gpt-and-image-generation/

Implement the human-in-the loop as per example.

Optional:
Image generation is pretty costly to me and uses my api-key which costs money.
Can you find a cheaper alternative, maybe u can use something with your account.
Maybe Gemini (Google AI studio) allows image generation as well?

Update so that it generates 2 images (1 with openai, other with gemini) and it also renames the files accordingly (for example 'generate-file-gemini.png)
