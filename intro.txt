Generative AI is a vast technology that has changed the world and yet is changing.
We probs have all used and have been impressed by chatgpt, but there is much more to generative AI as technology.
It changing very fields and seems to be a threat how we work and even that it may be able to replace us in the work environment.

However, i welcome you to see not a threat but an opportunity. 
Lots of my fellow developers feel threatened as they see so many great tools which can replace them but they ignore how many new opportunities appear.
IT industry has been stagnating for at least several years and only now the companies started building AI agents and integrate them into the processes.
We see now more and more 'AI startups' happening, investments being poured into them and the demand for 'AI engineers' ->
IT professionals who are capable to integrate Generative  AI technology into their existing processes and systems.

This is not the first course, but how this course is different is that we skip learning 'Python programming' 
and focus directly on understanding GEN-AI concepts and building the prototypes and products. We will utilise not only the automation platforms 
but also Agentic Coding tools such as Cursor and Claude Code. The programming experience helps here a lot but it is not necessary as we allow the tools to do the basic Coding
and i will tech you 'agentic coding' techniques to build and deploy the minimal products easier.

By end on the course you will understand most of the recent developments and techniques that happen right now in generative AI.
The course is intense and technical, but this will allow you to understand how many production 'AI products' work 
and u will have experience to start implementing GEN-AI ideas yourself. 
The course will cover most of the current trends right now:
Open source model usage, fine-tuning, mcp, AI agents, Agent building frameworks, techniques to handle hallucinations and etc.

There are very few real experts in generative AI as the technology is still very fresh (remember that chatgpt 3.5 only was launched 2.5 years ago)
but you will learn from (and learn together) from a person who is actually working with GEN-AI technology in Danske Bank. 
I will try to keep the course as practical and share the best practices (and failures) of working with GEN-AI professionally.
